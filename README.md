# Human_Genes
This repository contains the code and resulting output file for approximating the current number of uncharacterized human protein coding genes. The code gets the list of human protein-coding genes from a regularly updated data file on the HGNC website, 'protein-coding_gene.txt'. For each gene symbol, if it is not in the title of any papers on PubMed, that gene is put into the output file 'uncharacterized_human_genes.txt'.
